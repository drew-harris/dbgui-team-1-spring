# DB GUI Team 1 Project

## Set Up

1. Ensure that Node and NPM are installed on your machine
   - You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. You should see the installed version number
2. Clone this repository
3. Download packages by running `npm i` or `npm install` in the root folder of the repo. This will install packages for both the frontend and backend.

4. Start the development server:
   - Run `npm run dev` in the **_root_** of the repo to start both the frontend and backend development environments.
     - The website and server will update live when you make changes
     - The backend is located at http://localhost:8000
     - The frontend is located at http://localhost:3000

### Additional Commands

- `npm run build` : builds both the frontend and backend for production
- `npm run serve` : runs both the frontend and backend after you've built it
- `npm run format` : Formats all code in the project
  - Turning on "Format on Save" in VS Code is _highly recommended_
